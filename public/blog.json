    "blog": "Many of us do not know properly what are the actual differences between  Java Scrictp and Node JS. Today I'm gonna discuss some of the main differences between Javascript and node js. Java Script is actually single treated programming language. On the other hand Node, js is a runtime of JavaScript. Java Script is running in any web browser with a proper browser engine like the V8 engine for google chrome, and the JavaScript core engine for Safari. But Node JS is using the v8 engine directly. It actually helps us to use Javascript from outside of the browser."

    "blog": "In java script for back end most of the time we use Node JS and Mongodb. This two this plays in defferent ways. Node JS is actually a runtime of Java script that is used for making backend. On the other hand Mongodb is database. We use Mongodb for store our data of our site. MongoDB facilitate to store database in json(javascript object notation) (or simply when data in form of key value pair) this is very fast and efficient so you should use it when you have key value pair to store(json data). On the other site. It is very lightweight and fast. There has been over 200000 visits on this website in three weeks and minimal server resources has been able to handle it all. "
